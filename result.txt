PROJECT NAME

CertifyChain

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT (2 lines)

CertifyChain turns online certificates (e.g., Udemy) into private soulbound NFTs, then derives “view” NFTs for selective disclosure of chosen fields. On-chain commitments and signatures verify authenticity without exposing full data.

VIDEO DEMO

Contract address(es) and chain(s)
	•	CertificatePrivateNFT: 0x67deeAcfA815903f48605d85B5279D9c729969B0
	•	CertificateViewNFT: 
	•	Chain(s): <insert chain(s), e.g., Paseo testnet / EVM-compatible>

    Bounties (how we integrated sponsor tech)

Smart Contract dApp Development on Paseo testnet – $3400
	•	What we built: A privacy-preserving credential system using two contracts:
	1.	CertificatePrivateNFT — mints a soulbound NFT per verified certificate; stores an on-chain cryptographic commitment (hash), while encrypted attributes remain off-chain.
	2.	CertificateViewNFT — issues shareable “view” NFTs that disclose only selected fields.
	•	Verification model (no ZK): Rely on on-chain commitments and signed attestations to confirm disclosed fields match the underlying private token—without revealing extra data.
	•	Why it fits the bounty: Original Solidity dApp, deployed on Polkadot EVM testnet, clear UX (mint, derive views, share links), and practical impact for verifiable education credentials.
    	•	Frontend: Minimal UI to upload/verify a certificate, mint the private SBT, and generate view NFTs for selective disclosure.
